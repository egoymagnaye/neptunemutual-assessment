## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Brief Overview

The project includes the two widgets:
- Converter Form
- Wallet Details Popup

I used Tailwind.css to style the app. Although the app has fewer components, I still use React Context for easy state management, like the loading state and toggling of modal/popups.
